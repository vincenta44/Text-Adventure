                                         ==== By: Vincent Ains ====
********************************************************************************************************************
Hello adventurer...you have quite a journey ahead of you.
There is a dangerous Dragon in his Den up the path and through the magic gate.
You have the job to kill it.
Be careful and move slowly throughout the path, once you go down it you can't go back.
You have nothing, so anything you find on your way will be helpful.
    I hear along the path there are secret compartments that some people hide pretty valuable items.
    Not all places them, but those that do can prove very useful.
    I have this amulet that can glows when there are secret places, however you can only use it 3 times and if you use
    it all in random places and find nothing...well that's on you.
Have a safe journey and do not come back without the Dragon's treasure.
